      <p>Genshin Impact is an open-world, action/adventure MMORPG. Upon the intro cutscene of the game, the player can opt to play as Aether, the male or Lumine, the female. Then begins your journey across the land of Teyvat, the continent in which Genshin takes place. You meet your float tutorial Paimon, who'll serve as your general guide and constant companion. </p>

      <p>Like any gacha games, Genshin has a mechanic call wishing which allows your to toss in "Fates" in attempt to call forth allies or weapons. Genshin's primary in-game currency is called "primogems". These primogems can be acquired either by purchasing with real money or through in-game quests, events and other activities. 160 primogems = 1 "Fate" or one wish. There are 2 types of "Fates". The "Acquainted Fates" are used for the Standard Banner which is permanent. The "Intertwine Fates" are used for the Limited-Time Banner, which will occurr for a limited time with certain characters having increased rates.</p>

      <p>While Genshin is consider a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game or MMORPG for short, it is primary single player. This game has some of the most breath-taking visual scenes there is to offer. Story is compelling and immersive. There is currently not a PvP mode in Genshin. The game has a co-op mode in which other Genshin players can enter your world and partake in explorations or boss battle by your side.The difference in power and utility between are quite broad in some cases, thus not having a PvP may not be a bad thing for this game.</p>

      <p>Lastly is Genshin's combat mechanic. Apart for equipping your character with a weapon and merely haching away at enemies, Genshin has a combat mechanic call elemental reaction. Every character is this game is aligned with one of the seven elements. The seven elements are: Anemo- wind, Electro- lightning, Cryo- ice, Hydro- water, Pyro- fire, Geo - earth, Dendro- nature. The seven element form the core of Genshin's combat and exploration. By hitting an enemy with one element, you mark that enemy with the corresponding element. Then if you hit the marked enemy with another element, an elemental reaction occurs. Elemental reactions opens up all kinds of possibilities, from freeze your enemies in place to launching them with explosions to straight up massive damage multiplies. Understanding how to use reactions properly make fighting tougher foes easier, however enemies can also inflict reactions on you.</p>
